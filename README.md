## Getting Started
This project is using Jekyll and github pages for hosting. First install gem dependencies by running:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Next, start the server by running:

```
jekyll serve -w
```

The website should now be running at http://localhost:4000. To make changes simply push up to the master branch.
